<p>In June 2017, I defended my Ph.D. thesis in sociology at Stockholm University. My dissertation research was supervised by Prof. Dr. Jens Rydgren and Prof. Dr. Martin Hällsten.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>A contentiously debated hypothesis states that native majorities are unwilling to support the provision of government-funded welfare to those whom they do not consider to be part of their own sociocultural ingroup, especially when sociocultural or ethnic otherness and disadvantage overlap. Consequently, majorities’ willingness to accept disadvantaged immigrant groups as legitimate members of the welfare community is central to the social cohesion of diversifying societies. My dissertation consists of a comprehensive summary and four original studies addressing the interplay between migration-induced diversity and social cohesion through the lens of majority attitudes and the micro and macro contexts within which they are embedded. Focusing on Sweden and Germany, I use representative survey data to show that the conflict between diversity and welfare solidarity is not expressed as general majority opposition to welfare, but rather as welfare chauvinism —&ndash;opposition to government assistance benefiting immigrants. The direct observation of immigrant unemployment in the neighbourhood increases natives’ preference for spending on other natives over spending on immigrants, while competition with immigrants at the workplace does not. Importantly, negative prejudice against immigrants increase welfare chauvinism, disregarding first-hand experience of immigrant unemployment or competition. Moving outside the realm of fist-hand experience, I use semi-automated analysis of a vast corpus of online news contents to study an alternative source of prejudicial attitudes. Yet, I do not find that immigrants are systematically stigmatised as undeserving recipients of welfare. The thesis thus suggests that immigrant disadvantage and welfare chauvinism are tightly bound, even in the absence of toxic discourses. However, the fact that workplace sharing does not appear to foster chauvinistic attitudes suggests that labor market integration is key to social cohesion.</p>

<p>As part of my dissertation research at Stockholm University, I was working in the survey project &ldquo;Xenophobia and Immigration-Negative Attitudes: A Multilevel and Relational Approach,&rdquo; which was funded by FORTE &mdash; the Swedish Research Council for Health, Working Life and Welfare (PI: Jens Rydgren).</p>
