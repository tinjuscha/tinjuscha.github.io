      <description>Toward the end of my Ph.D., I had the opportunity to co-apply for research funding from FORTE &amp;mdash; the Swedish Research Council for Health, Working Life and Welfare, together with a wonderful group of researchers at Umeå University. Fortunately, our research program entitled &amp;ldquo;The Evolution of Prejudice&amp;rdquo; (PI: Mikael Hjerm) and with it, the sub-project for which I co-applied were selected for funding. They both began in the fall of 2017 and run for 3+3 years (pending a positive mid-term review).</description>

      <description>In June 2017, I defended my Ph.D. thesis in sociology at Stockholm University. My dissertation research was supervised by Prof. Dr. Jens Rydgren and Prof. Dr. Martin Hällsten.

      <description>Few pieces of advice have been imparted upon me more frequently than that I should finally put together a professional webpage. After feeling guilty about not heeding my mentors&amp;rsquo; and colleagues&amp;rsquo; advice for years, I have now finally managed to set up this website and I am excited to see how it will develop. I am hoping to keep this space updated with regular posts about ongoing research projects, teaching activities, talks, events, and other news.</description>
