---

As of October 1, I am a visiting researcher at the Institute of Political Science at the University of Duisburg-Essen. There, I am affiliated with the [Chair of Empirical Political Science](https://www.uni-due.de/politik/goerres.php).

I am looking forward to working with Prof. Dr. Achim Goerres and his team, to learning from teaching in a new academic environment, and to meeting new colleagues across the faculty of social sciences.
