title: "Welcome to my personal webpage and blog"

Few pieces of advice have been imparted upon me more frequently than that I should finally put together a professional webpage. After feeling guilty about not heeding my mentors' and colleagues' advice for years, I have now finally managed to set up this website and I am excited to see how it will develop. I am hoping to keep this space updated with regular posts about ongoing research projects, teaching activities, talks, events, and other news.

Thank you for visiting

Tina
