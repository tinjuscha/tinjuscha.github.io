description: "Political sociologist, who knows very little about animals"
---

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher working at the intersection between sociology and political science. 

When I first told my grandparents that my field of studies was sociology, they misheard and informed their friends that I was involved in "something to do with animals." Over the years, we managed to clear up the confusion. They now know that I am, in fact, not working in zoology but researching "something to do with politics" instead. 

I believe that sums it up pretty well. However, if you would like to know more, you can find out below and in the other sections of this blog. 

## Academic affiliations

My postdoctoral position is based at the [Department of Sociology](http://www.soc.umu.se/english) at Ume√• University in northern Sweden. Currently, I am working off-site, in Germany. I am dividing my time between Berlin, my family's home, and Duisburg, where I am a visiting researcher at the [Institute of Political Science](https://www.uni-due.de/politik/institute.php) at the University of Duisburg-Essen and affiliated with the Chair of Empirical Political Science. 

I am also a research fellow at Stockholm University's [Department of Sociology](https://www.sociology.su.se/english/). 

In June 2017, I received my Ph.D. from Stockholm University. I also hold an M.Sc. (Sociology) from the University of Oxford and a B.A. (Integrated Social Sciences) from Jacobs University Bremen.

## Research interests

My research is mainly concerned with the study of political attitudes across European societies. 

I am especially interested in intergroup relations in the face of large-scale migration and in questions of social solidarity in the context of the welfare state. My research asks: 

Why do people support some types of welfare more than others? How is this shaped by negative prejudice against welfare recipients and "non-native" welfare recipients in particular? How do first-hand experiences affect such attitudes? And what roles do news media and political debates play in fostering or assuaging prejudice?  

Empirically, I draw on different methods and data sources, ranging from statistical analyses of (register-linked) public opinion surveys to the computer assisted content analysis of large news corpora.
