My experience so far has made me realise that teaching and working with students to facilitate their own research ideas are two of my favourite aspects about being an academic. When I finished my doctorate in June 2017, I thus decided to dedicate more of my  time to teaching and becoming a better instructor.
 
Below you can find a list of my teaching activities. 

As main instructor: 

* **Humboldt University Berlin**
  * ["Immigration, Social Cohesion, and the Welfare State"](https://agnes.hu-berlin.de/lupo/rds?

  * ["Citizenship, Migration, and Identities: Immigration and Welfare State Solidarity in Sweden and Germany"](https://www.berlinsummerschool.de/) (invited lecturer at the Berlin Summer School of Social Science, June 2018)
