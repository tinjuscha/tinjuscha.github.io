title: "Anti-immigrant prejudice through the lens of public discourses"
---

Toward the end of my Ph.D., I had the opportunity to co-apply for research funding from FORTE --- the Swedish Research Council for Health, Working Life and Welfare, together with a wonderful group of researchers at Ume√• University. Fortunately, our research program entitled "The Evolution of Prejudice" (PI: Mikael Hjerm) and with it, the sub-project for which I co-applied were selected for funding. They both began in the fall of 2017 and run for 3+3 years (pending a positive mid-term review).

## Summary 

The overarching question that guides the research program is how prejudice against immigrants evolves over time and across national contexts. 

The sub-project in which I am working together with [Janis Goldschmidt](https://superfluffy.github.io/) and [Prof. Dr. Rickard Danell](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rickard_Danell) seeks to examine the evolution of prejudice within and between societies by analysing how the content of public discourses on immigrants changes over time. In particular, we are interested in the intersecting portrayals of immigration and poverty or welfare receipt, as well as immigration and crime.

A more detailed description of ongoing studies will follow soon.

## Methods

While web scraping and count-based natural language processing are widely used methods in industry settings, academia has been slower to utilise them for research purposes. We put online news contents to social scientific use by merging methods from machine learning (web-scraping, automated semantic indexing and sentiment analysis), computational corpus linguistics (frequency and co-occurrence counts), and traditional sociological discourse analysis (qualitative coding based on quantitatively derived sampling).
