<p>I am a Postdoctoral Researcher working at the intersection between sociology and political science.</p>

<p>When I first told my grandparents that my field of studies was sociology, they misheard and informed their friends that I was involved in &ldquo;something to do with animals.&rdquo; Over the years, we managed to clear up the confusion. They now know that I am, in fact, not working in zoology but researching &ldquo;something to do with politics&rdquo; instead.</p>

<p>I believe that sums it up pretty well. However, if you would like to know more, you can find out below and in the other sections of this blog.</p>

<h2 id="academic-affiliations">Academic affiliations</h2>

<p>My postdoctoral position is based at the <a href="http://www.soc.umu.se/english">Department of Sociology</a> at Ume√• University in northern Sweden. Currently, I am working off-site, in Germany. I am dividing my time between Berlin, my family&rsquo;s home, and Duisburg, where I am a visiting researcher at the <a href="https://www.uni-due.de/politik/institute.php">Institute of Political Science</a> at the University of Duisburg-Essen and affiliated with the Chair of Empirical Political Science.</p>

<p>I am also a research fellow at Stockholm University&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.sociology.su.se/english/">Department of Sociology</a>.</p>

<p>In June 2017, I received my Ph.D. from Stockholm University. I also hold an M.Sc. (Sociology) from the University of Oxford and a B.A. (Integrated Social Sciences) from Jacobs University Bremen.</p>

<h2 id="research-interests">Research interests</h2>

<p>My research is mainly concerned with the study of political attitudes across European societies.</p>

<p>I am especially interested in intergroup relations in the face of large-scale migration and in questions of social solidarity in the context of the welfare state. My research asks:</p>

<p>Why do people support some types of welfare more than others? How is this shaped by negative prejudice against welfare recipients and &ldquo;non-native&rdquo; welfare recipients in particular? How do first-hand experiences affect such attitudes? And what roles do news media and political debates play in fostering or assuaging prejudice?</p>

<p>Empirically, I draw on different methods and data sources, ranging from statistical analyses of (register-linked) public opinion surveys to the computer assisted content analysis of large news corpora.</p>
