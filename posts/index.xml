      <description>As of October 1, I am a visiting researcher at the Institute of Political Science at the University of Duisburg-Essen. There, I am affiliated with the Chair of Empirical Political Science.
I am looking forward to working with Prof. Dr. Achim Goerres and his team, to learning from teaching in a new academic environment, and to meeting new colleagues across the faculty of social sciences.</description>

      <description>Few pieces of advice have been imparted upon me more frequently than that I should finally put together a professional webpage. After feeling guilty about not heeding my mentors&amp;rsquo; and colleagues&amp;rsquo; advice for years, I have now finally managed to set up this website and I am excited to see how it will develop. I am hoping to keep this space updated with regular posts about ongoing research projects, teaching activities, talks, events, and other news.</description>
